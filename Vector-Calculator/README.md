# Vector-Calculator
Vector Calculator built in C and python — supports common vector operations (addition, subtraction, dot product, etc.) with a simple console interface.

## What It Can Do
-  **Add vectors** (because teamwork makes the dream work)  
-  **Subtract vectors** (sometimes you gotta cut people off)  
-  **Dot product** (the OG collab check)  
-  **Magnitude** (size does matter… in vectors at least)

# FirstCgame
 Just built my first game in C! ðŸŽ‰ Inspired by a @CodeWithHarry YouTube video, but added my own logic and twist to make it mine. Exciting and super fun to build!

##  Game Concept
- The program picks a secret number(1-100).
- You guess until you get it right.
- Tracks the number of attempts you make.
- Simple, addictive, and a fun intro to C programming logic!
- Person with lower number of guesses wins. Bash the opponent for a party lol!!

##  Features
- **Custom logic** for number checking.
- **Guess counter** to track attempts.
- **Helpful hints**: tells you if your guess is higher or lower.
